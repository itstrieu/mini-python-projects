# Mini Python Projects
### Building with AI

This repository contains a collection of projects designed to help me develop key skills and understand essential concepts on my path to becoming a machine learning engineer. Each project is a deliberate step toward mastering software engineering and machine learning.

Before using AI tools, I viewed software development and engineering as areas that might be beyond my reach, thinking I should focus on analysis instead. With the support of AI, I feel empowered to confidently pursue these skills and tackle challenges that once seemed intimidating. AI has become an essential resource, accelerating my learning and enabling me to progress efficiently.

This repository reflects my commitment to learning through building. It documents the journey of acquiring knowledge, refining skills, and moving closer to my goals.

This repository contains multiple small projects:
- **Project 1**: Real-Time Weather Analysis Tool
- **Project 2**: Color-Based Object Detection

Each project has its own directory with specific files and a README.md.
