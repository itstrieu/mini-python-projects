# Color-Based Object Detection

A beginner-friendly project using OpenCV to detect objects based on color. The goal is to build foundational computer vision skills by detecting a specific color (e.g., a tennis ball) in an image or video.

## Learning Objectives
- **Color Spaces**: Learn how to work with different color spaces, especially BGR and HSV.
- **Thresholding**: Isolate objects based on color using masking techniques.
- **Contour Detection**: Identify object boundaries and draw bounding boxes or circles around them.

## Skills Practiced
- **Image Processing**: Manipulate and analyze image data using OpenCV.
- **Python Scripting**: Write clean, modular Python code for computer vision tasks.
- **Debugging and Optimization**: Tune color thresholds and filters to enhance detection accuracy.

## Project Significance
This project serves as a stepping stone to more advanced computer vision tasks such as real-time object tracking. The foundational skills learned here are applicable to many machine learning and computer vision pipelines.
